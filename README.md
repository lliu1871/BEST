# BEST version 3.0
BEST is a free phylogenetics package of programs to estimate the posterior distribution of species trees using multilocus molecular data that accounts for deep coalescence but not for other issues such as horizontal transfer. It is intended to implement the Bayesian hierarchical model proposed by Liang Liu and Dennis Pearl and further developed in collaboration with Scott Edwards.
